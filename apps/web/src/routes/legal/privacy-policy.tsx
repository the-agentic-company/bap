        number, contact person&apos;s name, email address, phone number, etc.). Confirm their
        acceptance of the General Terms. Confirm their registration. Access to the Services is
        possible by connecting to the Site from a computer, smartphone, or tablet. The use of the
        Services requires a high-speed internet connection and, if applicable, a mobile internet
        connection. Clients are responsible for providing the necessary computer and
        telecommunication equipment to access the Site. The Services can only be accessed from one
        connection at a time. When creating an account with an email address, the Client is prompted
        to choose a password, which ensures the confidentiality of the information contained in
        their account. To validate the registration, the Service Provider sends a confirmation email
        to the email address provided by the Client. The Client then activates their account by
        clicking on the hyperlink provided for this purpose in the confirmation email. Each Client
        guarantees the truthfulness and accuracy of the information provided for their registration,
        agrees to notify any subsequent changes, and guarantees that such information does not
        infringe upon the rights of third parties. The Client can modify this information, as well
        as their login credentials and password, from their account on the Site. The Client
        undertakes not to disclose or transfer their account, login credentials, and password, and
        is solely responsible for their use until they are deactivated. The Client must immediately
        inform the Service Provider of any loss or unauthorized use of their account. The Service
        Provider reserves the right to delete the account of any Client who has provided inaccurate
        information.

        event of the Client&apos;s unjustified refusal to provide the requested information and/or
        documentation, the Service Provider reserves the right to refuse or cancel the order without

        manifestly illegal content that is brought to its attention, particularly when the existence
        of such content has been notified to it by a Client in accordance with applicable
        regulations. Furthermore, the Service Provider strives to ensure access to and proper
        functioning of the Site twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week. However, the Service
        Provider cannot exclude the possibility that access to and functioning of the Site may be
        interrupted, particularly in cases of force majeure, malfunction of the Clients&apos;
        equipment or internet network, telecommunication operator failure, power supply
        interruption, abnormal, unlawful, or fraudulent use of the Site by a Client or a third
        party, decisions by competent authorities, or for any other reason. The Service Provider
        also reserves the right to make any modifications and improvements of its choice to the Site
        and the Services, related to technical advancements or proper functioning. General and
        temporary interruptions of the Site and the Services will, whenever possible, be notified
